# FastAPI ChatBot 🤖🌍

A conversational chatbot built with **FastAPI** and **Groq**, designed to respond to **map** and **navigation-related** queries in a friendly, conversational tone.

## Features ✨
- **Friendly conversational tone**: The chatbot greets and interacts in a natural way like "Hello, what's up?" while staying focused on answering map and navigation-related questions.
- **Map & Navigation Queries**: Handles questions related to **locations**, **directions**, **routes**, and **nearby places**.
- **Error Handling**: Responds politely when the question is unrelated to the domain (e.g., "Sorry, I can only help with map and navigation-related questions.") 🚫🗺️.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

To run this project locally, you will need:

- Python 3.7 or higher 🐍
- `pip` (Python package installer) 📦
- An API key from **Groq** to interact with their chatbot model 🔑.

## Setup Instructions 🔧

### 1. Clone the Repository 🧑‍💻

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/FastApi_ChatBot.git
cd FastApi_ChatBot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies 📲

Make sure to create and activate a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects.

#### On Linux/macOS:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### On Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Now, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables 🔑

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add your **Groq API Key**:

```ini
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

### 4. Run the Application 🚀

To start the FastAPI app, use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The app will be running locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. 🎉

### 5. Access the OpenAPI Documentation 📖

Once the app is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:

```plaintext
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

This allows you to test the bot directly through the browser. 👨‍💻

## API Endpoints 📡

### `POST /api/v1/chat/ask`

This endpoint is used to interact with the chatbot.

#### Request Body:

```json
{
  "message": "string", // The user's query
  "role": "user" // The role of the sender (currently supports "user")
}
```

#### Response:

```json
{
  "response": "string" // The chatbot's reply
}
```

### Example:
**Request**:
```json
{
  "message": "What's the best route to the nearest park?",
  "role": "user"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "response": "Hey, let me find that for you! The nearest park is 5 minutes away, and you can go down Elm Street."
}
```

## Error Handling 🚨

- If the query is not related to maps or navigation, the bot will respond with:
  - `"Sorry, I can only help with map and navigation-related questions."`
